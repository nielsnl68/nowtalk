/*
 * the following sketch is a proto of a chainable class system.
 * with on function in the Impl class you can hook that class
 * to his predecessor class.
 * This system will be used to create a new I2S library where
 * you can link (chain) different proccesses together to receive
 * sound from different sources decode/encode them end send the
 * result out again.
 * This example shows also a way to interact with each other with
 * the use of an interface class.
